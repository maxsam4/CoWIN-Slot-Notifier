# CoWIN Slot Notifier
I've been trying to book a vaccine slot for a week but it's fucking always booked. So, as any other normal person will do, I'm creating a script to notify me whenever a slot is available.

To use the script, rename `config.json.sample` to `config.json`, and fill your data in it. Afterwards, run `node index.js`. 

I'll add detailed instructions if anyone actually comes here to use this :)
